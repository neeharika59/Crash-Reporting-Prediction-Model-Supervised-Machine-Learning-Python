This project focuses on developing a **machine learning model** to predict the **severity of driver injuries and vehicle damage** in collisions based on factors like **collision type, weather conditions, traffic density, and substance abuse presence**. 

Using a **Decision Tree model**, we achieved **83.47% accuracy for injury severity** and **53.45% for vehicle damage extent**. Our analysis identified key contributors such as **speed limits (35 mph), crash location, and cross-street type**, leading to recommendations for **lower speed limits in high-risk areas, improved infrastructure planning, and optimized emergency resource allocation**. The insights from this model can support **law enforcement, policymakers, and insurance providers** in enhancing road safety, improving response strategies, and reducing accident severity.

Skills: Supervised Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Model, Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Voting, Stacking), Python (matplotlib, sklearn, seaborn, numpy, pandas, scipy)
